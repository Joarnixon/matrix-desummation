# This project is a small experiment
### It does not aim to provide a new theorem or strict proof, but anyway it's an interesting idea.
### Sometimes inspiration to a problem can come via looking from another perspective or even from whole different field of research.
### All instructions, math and code can be found in `presentation.ipynb`. Open it in github or clone the repository
